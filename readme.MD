## 🚀 Text-to-Code | Code-to-Text Converter

This is a simple yet powerful web application that converts regular text into a numerical code and vice versa. It's a fun and practical project designed to demonstrate my skills in **HTML5**, **CSS3 (with Bootstrap 5.3)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

### ✨ Features

  * **Bidirectional Conversion:** Easily switch between converting **Text to Code** and **Code to Text** with a single button click.
  * **Intuitive Interface:** A clean and responsive design built with **Bootstrap 5.3** ensures a smooth user experience across all devices.
  * **Persistent Storage:** Your converted codes are automatically saved to your browser's **local storage**, so you can access them even after refreshing the page.
  * **Clipboard Functionality:** A convenient "Copy" button lets you instantly copy the result to your clipboard.
  * **Dynamic UI:** The interface updates dynamically as you type, providing real-time conversion results.
  * **Clear & Reset:** The "Delete All Data" button allows you to clear all saved conversions from local storage.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** For the application's structure.
  * **CSS3:** For styling, with a focus on a modern and clean aesthetic.
  * **Bootstrap 5.3:** Utilized for a responsive layout and pre-built components, accelerating development.
  * **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers all the core functionality, including the conversion logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management.
  * **SweetAlert2:** A JavaScript library used to create beautiful, responsive, and customizable pop-up messages for a better user experience (e.g., confirmation of a successful copy).

### 💻 How It Works

The core of the application is a JavaScript `switch` statement that maps each letter of the alphabet to its corresponding position (e.g., `a` = `1`, `b` = `2`, and so on). A separate function handles the reverse conversion from numbers back to letters. Spaces are represented by a hyphen (`-`) to maintain word separation.

### 🎨 Design & Accessibility

The design prioritizes clarity and ease of use. The color scheme is simple and consistent, with strong contrast for readability. The use of Bootstrap ensures the layout is mobile-friendly and accessible.
